# Android R.A.T Client
This is the android version of the [C# R.A.T Client](https://github.com/AdvancedHacker101/C-Sharp-R.A.T-Client) written in java.  
The client connects to the [C# R.A.T Server](https://github.com/AdvancedHacker101/C-Sharp-R.A.T-Server)  using the [C# Android R.A.T Server](https://github.com/AdvancedHacker101/android-c-sharp-rat-server) plugin.  
The client is capable of:  
- Listeninng to microphone
- Streaming camera (back and front)
- Sending SMS Message
- Dump contacts and calendar events
- Geolocation
- Battery information
- File Management

Some of the functions are not tested, so this is not a final version and can contain bugs.  
Also there is connectivity issues currently, but i'm also looking forward to solve that.  
Let's just say this is a beta version.
